# Air-bark-n-bark
Taking one’s dog on campervan or RV trips is becoming a common and exciting idea for travellers, particularly since the COVID-19 travel restrictions have lifted. Often, caravan holidays require several weeks or months of absence, and pet owners typically do not wish or are unable to leave their dogs at home for such extended periods. However, travelling with a pet is not always easy since the majority of establishments do not allow dogs on the premises. Although there are plenty of camping and parking areas that are pet-friendly, most restaurants, national parks, malls, shops and many tourist destinations do not allow pets. In such cases, dog owners have no choice but to leave their pet behind. However, it is not advisable to leave dogs unsupervised in a campervan or motorhome, particularly in hot weather. Air Bark'n'Bark will be a website and mobile app that will connect travelling pet owners (finders) with other travellers (minders) who can care for their dogs while they are on the road. The app will have registered users will be travelling, they can toggle their current location to search for possible dog sitters within a specific area who are able to watch their pet. After viewing “minders” profiles, users can choose a pet sitter and contact each other via an in-app chat.
